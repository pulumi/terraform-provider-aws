# Resource: aws_network_acl_association

Provides an network ACL association resource which allows you to associate your network ACL with any subnet(s).

~> **NOTE on Network ACLs and Network ACL Associations:** the provider provides both a standalone network ACL association resource
and a network ACL resource with a `subnet_ids` attribute. Do not use the same subnet ID in both a network ACL
resource and a network ACL association resource. Doing so will cause a conflict of associations and will overwrite the association.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_network_acl_association" "main" {
  network_acl_id = aws_network_acl.main.id
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.main.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `network_acl_id` - (Required) The ID of the network ACL.
* `subnet_id` - (Required) The ID of the associated Subnet.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the network ACL association
