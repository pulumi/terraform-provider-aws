Manages an RDS database instance snapshot. For managing RDS database cluster snapshots, see the `aws_db_cluster_snapshot` resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_db_instance" "bar" {
  allocated_storage = 10
  engine            = "mysql"
  engine_version    = "5.6.21"
  instance_class    = "db.t2.micro"
  name              = "baz"
  password          = "barbarbarbar"
  username          = "foo"

  maintenance_window      = "Fri:09:00-Fri:09:30"
  backup_retention_period = 0
  parameter_group_name    = "default.mysql5.6"
}

resource "aws_db_snapshot" "test" {
  db_instance_identifier = aws_db_instance.bar.id
  db_snapshot_identifier = "testsnapshot1234"
}
```

* `license_model` - License model information for the restored DB instance.
* `option_group_name` - Provides the option group name for the DB snapshot.
* `source_db_snapshot_identifier` - The DB snapshot Arn that the DB snapshot was copied from. It only has value in case of cross customer or cross region copy.
