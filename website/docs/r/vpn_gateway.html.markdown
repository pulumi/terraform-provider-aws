# Resource: aws_vpn_gateway

Provides a resource to create a VPC VPN Gateway.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_vpn_gateway" "vpn_gw" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

  tags = {
    Name = "main"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `vpc_id` - (Optional) The VPC ID to create in.
* `availability_zone` - (Optional) The Availability Zone for the virtual private gateway.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. .If configured with a provider `default_tags` configuration block present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `amazon_side_asn` - (Optional) The Autonomous System Number (ASN) for the Amazon side of the gateway. If you don't specify an ASN, the virtual private gateway is created with the default ASN.

* `arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the VPN Gateway.
* `id` - The ID of the VPN Gateway.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider `default_tags` configuration block.

```
