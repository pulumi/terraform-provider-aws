# Resource: aws_elastic_beanstalk_application_version

Provides an Elastic Beanstalk Application Version Resource. Elastic Beanstalk allows
you to deploy and manage applications in the AWS cloud without worrying about
the infrastructure that runs those applications.

This resource creates a Beanstalk Application Version that can be deployed to a Beanstalk
Environment.

~> **NOTE on Application Version Resource:**  When using the Application Version resource with multiple
Elastic Beanstalk Environments it is possible that an error may be returned
when attempting to delete an Application Version while it is still in use by a different environment.
To work around this you can either create each environment in a separate AWS account or create your `aws_elastic_beanstalk_application_version` resources with a unique names in your Elastic Beanstalk Application. For example &lt;revision&gt;-&lt;environment&gt;.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "default" {
  bucket = "tftest.applicationversion.bucket"
}

resource "aws_s3_object" "default" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.default.id
  key    = "beanstalk/go-v1.zip"
  source = "go-v1.zip"
}

resource "aws_elastic_beanstalk_application" "default" {
  name        = "tf-test-name"
  description = "tf-test-desc"
}

resource "aws_elastic_beanstalk_application_version" "default" {
  name        = "tf-test-version-label"
  application = "tf-test-name"
  description = "application version"
  bucket      = aws_s3_bucket.default.id
  key         = aws_s3_object.default.id
}
```
