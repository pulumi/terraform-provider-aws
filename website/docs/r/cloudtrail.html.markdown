# Resource: aws_cloudtrail

Provides a CloudTrail resource.

-> **Tip:** For a multi-region trail, this resource must be in the home region of the trail.

-> **Tip:** For an organization trail, this resource must be in the master account of the organization.

## Example Usage

### Basic

Enable CloudTrail to capture all compatible management events in region.
For capturing events from services like IAM, `include_global_service_events` must be enabled.

```terraform
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

resource "aws_cloudtrail" "foobar" {
  name                          = "my-trail-foobar"
  s3_bucket_name                = aws_s3_bucket.foo.id
  s3_key_prefix                 = "prefix"
  include_global_service_events = false
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "foo" {
  bucket        = "my-test-trail"
  force_destroy = true
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "foo" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.foo.id
  policy = <<POLICY
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AWSCloudTrailAclCheck",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
              "Service": "cloudtrail.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetBucketAcl",
            "Resource": "${aws_s3_bucket.foo.arn}"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AWSCloudTrailWrite",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
              "Service": "cloudtrail.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "${aws_s3_bucket.foo.arn}/prefix/AWSLogs/${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "s3:x-amz-acl": "bucket-owner-full-control"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
POLICY
}
```

### Data Event Logging

CloudTrail can log [Data Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html) for certain services such as S3 objects and Lambda function invocations. Additional information about data event configuration can be found in the following links:

* [CloudTrail API DataResource documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_DataResource.html) (for basic event selector).
* [CloudTrail API AdvancedFieldSelector documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_AdvancedFieldSelector.html) (for advanced event selector).

#### Logging All Lambda Function Invocations By Using Basic Event Selectors

```terraform
resource "aws_cloudtrail" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  event_selector {
    read_write_type           = "All"
    include_management_events = true

    data_resource {
      type   = "AWS::Lambda::Function"
      values = ["arn:aws:lambda"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Logging All S3 Object Events By Using Basic Event Selectors

```terraform
resource "aws_cloudtrail" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  event_selector {
    read_write_type           = "All"
    include_management_events = true

    data_resource {
      type   = "AWS::S3::Object"
      values = ["arn:aws:s3"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Logging Individual S3 Bucket Events By Using Basic Event Selectors

```terraform
data "aws_s3_bucket" "important-bucket" {
  bucket = "important-bucket"
}

resource "aws_cloudtrail" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  event_selector {
    read_write_type           = "All"
    include_management_events = true

    data_resource {
      type = "AWS::S3::Object"

      # Make sure to append a trailing '/' to your ARN if you want
      # to monitor all objects in a bucket.
      values = ["${data.aws_s3_bucket.important-bucket.arn}/"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Logging All S3 Object Events Except For Two S3 Buckets By Using Advanced Event Selectors

```terraform
data "aws_s3_bucket" "not-important-bucket-1" {
  bucket = "not-important-bucket-1"
}

data "aws_s3_bucket" "not-important-bucket-2" {
  bucket = "not-important-bucket-2"
}

resource "aws_cloudtrail" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  advanced_event_selector {
    name = "Log all S3 objects events except for two S3 buckets"

    field_selector {
      field  = "eventCategory"
      equals = ["Data"]
    }

    field_selector {
      field = "resources.ARN"

      not_starts_with = [
        "${data.aws_s3_bucket.not-important-bucket-1.arn}/",
        "${data.aws_s3_bucket.not-important-bucket-2.arn}/"
      ]
    }

    field_selector {
      field  = "resources.type"
      equals = ["AWS::S3::Object"]
    }
  }

  advanced_event_selector {
    name = "Log readOnly and writeOnly management events"

    field_selector {
      field  = "eventCategory"
      equals = ["Management"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Logging Individual S3 Buckets And Specific Event Names By Using Advanced Event Selectors

```terraform
data "aws_s3_bucket" "important-bucket-1" {
  bucket = "important-bucket-1"
}

data "aws_s3_bucket" "important-bucket-2" {
  bucket = "important-bucket-2"
}

data "aws_s3_bucket" "important-bucket-3" {
  bucket = "important-bucket-3"
}

resource "aws_cloudtrail" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  advanced_event_selector {
    name = "Log PutObject and DeleteObject events for two S3 buckets"

    field_selector {
      field  = "eventCategory"
      equals = ["Data"]
    }

    field_selector {
      field = "eventName"

      equals = [
        "PutObject",
        "DeleteObject"
      ]
    }

    field_selector {
      field = "resources.ARN"

      #The trailing slash is intentional; do not exclude it.
      equals = [
        "${data.aws_s3_bucket.important-bucket-1.arn}/",
        "${data.aws_s3_bucket.important-bucket-2.arn}/"
      ]
    }

    field_selector {
      field  = "readOnly"
      equals = ["false"]
    }

    field_selector {
      field  = "resources.type"
      equals = ["AWS::S3::Object"]
    }
  }

  advanced_event_selector {
    name = "Log Delete* events for one S3 bucket"

    field_selector {
      field  = "eventCategory"
      equals = ["Data"]
    }

    field_selector {
      field       = "eventName"
      starts_with = ["Delete"]
    }

    field_selector {
      field = "resources.ARN"

      #The trailing slash is intentional; do not exclude it.
      equals = [
        "${data.aws_s3_bucket.important-bucket-3.arn}/important-prefix"
      ]
    }

    field_selector {
      field  = "readOnly"
      equals = ["false"]
    }

    field_selector {
      field  = "resources.type"
      equals = ["AWS::S3::Object"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Sending Events to CloudWatch Logs

```terraform
resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "example" {
  name = "Example"
}

resource "aws_cloudtrail" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  cloud_watch_logs_group_arn = "${aws_cloudwatch_log_group.example.arn}:*" # CloudTrail requires the Log Stream wildcard
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `s3_bucket_name` - (Required) Name of the S3 bucket designated for publishing log files.

The following arguments are optional:

* `advanced_event_selector` - (Optional) Specifies an advanced event selector for enabling data event logging. Fields documented below. Conflicts with `event_selector`.
