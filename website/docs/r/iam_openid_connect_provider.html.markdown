# Resource: aws_iam_openid_connect_provider

Provides an IAM OpenID Connect provider.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_iam_openid_connect_provider" "default" {
  url = "https://accounts.google.com"

  client_id_list = [
    "266362248691-342342xasdasdasda-apps.googleusercontent.com",
  ]

  thumbprint_list = []
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `url` - (Required) The URL of the identity provider. Corresponds to the _iss_ claim.
* `client_id_list` - (Required) A list of client IDs (also known as audiences). When a mobile or web app registers with an OpenID Connect provider, they establish a value that identifies the application. (This is the value that's sent as the client_id parameter on OAuth requests.)
* `thumbprint_list` - (Required) A list of server certificate thumbprints for the OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider's server certificate(s).
* `tags` - (Optional) Map of resource tags for the IAM OIDC provider. If configured with a provider `default_tags` configuration block present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - The ARN assigned by AWS for this provider.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider `default_tags` configuration block.

## Import

IAM OpenID Connect Providers can be imported using the `arn`, e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.default arn:aws:iam::123456789012:oidc-provider/accounts.google.com
```
