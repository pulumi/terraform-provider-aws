* `field_to_match` - (Optional) Part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect. See [Field to Match](#field-to-match) below for details.
* `text_transformation` - (Required) Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection.
  At least one required.
  See [Text Transformation](#text-transformation) below for details.

### Excluded Rule

The `excluded_rule` block supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the rule to exclude. If the rule group is managed by AWS, see the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-list.html) for a list of names in the appropriate rule group in use.

### Rule Action Override

The `rule_action_override` block supports the following arguments:

### Field to Match

The part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect. Include the single `field_to_match` type that you want to inspect, with additional specifications as needed, according to the type. You specify a single request component in `field_to_match` for each rule statement that requires it. To inspect more than one component of a web request, create a separate rule statement for each component. See the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-fields.html#waf-rule-statement-request-component) for more details.

The `field_to_match` block supports the following arguments:

~> **NOTE:** Only one of `all_query_arguments`, `body`, `cookies`, `headers`, `json_body`, `method`, `query_string`, `single_header`, `single_query_argument`, or `uri_path` can be specified.
An empty configuration block `{}` should be used when specifying `all_query_arguments`, `body`, `method`, or `query_string` attributes.

* `all_query_arguments` - (Optional) Inspect all query arguments.
* `body` - (Optional) Inspect the request body, which immediately follows the request headers.

### Forwarded IP Config

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address that's reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify
any header name. If the specified header isn't present in the request, AWS WAFv2 doesn't apply the rule to the web request at all.
AWS WAFv2 only evaluates the first IP address found in the specified HTTP header.

The `forwarded_ip_config` block supports the following arguments:

* `fallback_behavior` - (Required) - Match status to assign to the web request if the request doesn't have a valid IP address in the specified position. Valid values include: `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH`.
* `header_name` - (Required) - Name of the HTTP header to use for the IP address.

### IPSet Forwarded IP Config

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the IP address that's reported by the web request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

The `ip_set_forwarded_ip_config` block supports the following arguments:

* `fallback_behavior` - (Required) - Match status to assign to the web request if the request doesn't have a valid IP address in the specified position. Valid values include: `MATCH` or `NO_MATCH`.
* `header_name` - (Required) - Name of the HTTP header to use for the IP address.
* `position` - (Required) - Position in the header to search for the IP address. Valid values include: `FIRST`, `LAST`, or `ANY`. If `ANY` is specified and the header contains more than 10 IP addresses, AWS WAFv2 inspects the last 10.

### Headers

Inspect the request headers.

The `headers` block supports the following arguments:

* `match_pattern` - (Required) The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web request. The `match_pattern` block supports only one of the following arguments:
    * `all` - An empty configuration block that is used for inspecting all headers.
    * `included_headers` - An array of strings that will be used for inspecting headers that have a key that matches one of the provided values.
    * `excluded_headers` - An array of strings that will be used for inspecting headers that do not have a key that matches one of the provided values.
* `match_scope` - (Required) The parts of the headers to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify `All`, AWS WAF inspects both keys and values. Valid values include the following: `ALL`, `Key`, `Value`.
* `oversize_handling` - (Required) Oversize handling tells AWS WAF what to do with a web request when the request component that the rule inspects is over the limits. Valid values include the following: `CONTINUE`, `MATCH`, `NO_MATCH`. See the AWS [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-statement-oversize-handling.html) for more information.

### JSON Body

The `json_body` block supports the following arguments:

* `match_pattern` - (Required) The patterns to look for in the JSON body. You must specify exactly one setting: either `all` or `included_paths`. See [JsonMatchPattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_JsonMatchPattern.html) for details.
* `match_scope` - (Required) The parts of the JSON to match against using the `match_pattern`. Valid values are `ALL`, `KEY` and `VALUE`.
* `oversize_handling` - (Optional) What to do if the body is larger than can be inspected. Valid values are `CONTINUE` (default), `MATCH` and `NO_MATCH`.

### Single Header

Inspect a single header. Provide the name of the header to inspect, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer` (provided as lowercase strings).

The `single_header` block supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Optional) Name of the query header to inspect. This setting must be provided as lower case characters.

### Single Query Argument

Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of the query argument to inspect, such as `UserName` or `SalesRegion` (provided as lowercase strings).

The `single_query_argument` block supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Optional) Name of the query header to inspect. This setting must be provided as lower case characters.

### Cookies

Inspect the cookies in the web request. You can specify the parts of the cookies to inspect and you can narrow the set of cookies to inspect by including or excluding specific keys.
This is used to indicate the web request component to inspect, in the [FieldToMatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_FieldToMatch.html) specification.

The `cookies` block supports the following arguments:

* `match_pattern` - (Required) The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to inspect in a web request. You must specify exactly one setting: either `all`, `included_cookies` or `excluded_cookies`. More details: [CookieMatchPattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_CookieMatchPattern.html)
* `match_scope` - (Required) The parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule inspection criteria. If you specify All, AWS WAF inspects both keys and values. Valid values: `ALL`, `KEY`, `VALUE`
* `oversize_handling` - (Required) What AWS WAF should do if the cookies of the request are larger than AWS WAF can inspect. AWS WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of request cookies when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200 cookies and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to AWS WAF. Valid values: `CONTINUE`, `MATCH`, `NO_MATCH`

### Text Transformation

The `text_transformation` block supports the following arguments:

* `priority` - (Required) Relative processing order for multiple transformations that are defined for a rule statement. AWS WAF processes all transformations, from lowest priority to highest, before inspecting the transformed content.
