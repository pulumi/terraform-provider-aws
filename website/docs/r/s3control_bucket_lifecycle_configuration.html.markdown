# Resource: aws_s3control_bucket_lifecycle_configuration

Provides a resource to manage an S3 Control Bucket Lifecycle Configuration.

~> **NOTE:** Each S3 Control Bucket can only have one Lifecycle Configuration. Using multiple of this resource against the same S3 Control Bucket will result in perpetual differences each provider run.

-> This functionality is for managing [S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3onOutposts.html). To manage S3 Bucket Lifecycle Configurations in an AWS Partition, see the `aws_s3_bucket` resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_s3control_bucket_lifecycle_configuration" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3control_bucket.example.arn

  rule {
    expiration {
      days = 365
    }

    filter {
      prefix = "logs/"
    }

    id = "logs"
  }

  rule {
    expiration {
      days = 7
    }

    filter {
      prefix = "temp/"
    }

    id = "temp"
  }
}
```
