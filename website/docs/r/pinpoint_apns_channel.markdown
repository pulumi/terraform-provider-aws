# Resource: aws_pinpoint_apns_channel

Provides a Pinpoint APNs Channel resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_pinpoint_apns_channel" "apns" {
  application_id = aws_pinpoint_app.app.application_id

  certificate = file("./certificate.pem")
  private_key = file("./private_key.key")
}

resource "aws_pinpoint_app" "app" {}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `application_id` - (Required) The application ID.
* `enabled` - (Optional) Whether the channel is enabled or disabled. Defaults to `true`.
* `default_authentication_method` - (Optional) The default authentication method used for APNs.
  __NOTE__: Amazon Pinpoint uses this default for every APNs push notification that you send using the console.
  You can override the default when you send a message programmatically using the Amazon Pinpoint API, the AWS CLI, or an AWS SDK.
  If your default authentication type fails, Amazon Pinpoint doesn't attempt to use the other authentication type.

One of the following sets of credentials is also required.

If you choose to use __Certificate credentials__ you will have to provide:

* `certificate` - (Required) The pem encoded TLS Certificate from Apple.
* `private_key` - (Required) The Certificate Private Key file (ie. `.key` file).

If you choose to use __Key credentials__ you will have to provide:

* `bundle_id` - (Required) The ID assigned to your iOS app. To find this value, choose Certificates, IDs & Profiles, choose App IDs in the Identifiers section, and choose your app.
* `team_id` - (Required) The ID assigned to your Apple developer account team. This value is provided on the Membership page.
* `token_key` - (Required) The `.p8` file that you download from your Apple developer account when you create an authentication key.
* `token_key_id` - (Required) The ID assigned to your signing key. To find this value, choose Certificates, IDs & Profiles, and choose your key in the Keys section.
