# Resource: aws_ec2_traffic_mirror_target

Provides a Traffic mirror target.  
Read [limits and considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/traffic-mirroring-considerations.html) for traffic mirroring

## Example Usage

To create a basic traffic mirror session

```terraform
resource "aws_ec2_traffic_mirror_target" "nlb" {
  description               = "NLB target"
  network_load_balancer_arn = aws_lb.lb.arn
}

resource "aws_ec2_traffic_mirror_target" "eni" {
  description          = "ENI target"
  network_interface_id = aws_instance.test.primary_network_interface_id
}

resource "aws_ec2_traffic_mirror_target" "gwlb" {
  description                       = "GWLB target"
  gateway_load_balancer_endpoint_id = aws_vpc_endpoint.example.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `description` - (Optional, Forces new) A description of the traffic mirror session.
* `network_interface_id` - (Optional, Forces new) The network interface ID that is associated with the target.
* `network_load_balancer_arn` - (Optional, Forces new) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Network Load Balancer that is associated with the target.
* `gateway_load_balancer_endpoint_id` - (Optional, Forces new) The VPC Endpoint Id of the Gateway Load Balancer that is associated with the target.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider `default_tags` configuration block present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

**NOTE:** Either `network_interface_id` or `network_load_balancer_arn` should be specified and both should not be specified together

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Traffic Mirror target.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider `default_tags` configuration block.
* `arn` - The ARN of the traffic mirror target.
* `owner_id` - The ID of the AWS account that owns the traffic mirror target.

## Import

Traffic mirror targets can be imported using the `id`, e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_ec2_traffic_mirror_target.target tmt-0c13a005422b86606
```
