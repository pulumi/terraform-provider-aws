# Resource: aws_vpc_endpoint_service_allowed_principal

Provides a resource to allow a principal to discover a VPC endpoint service.

~> **NOTE on VPC Endpoint Services and VPC Endpoint Service Allowed Principals:** This provider provides
both a standalone VPC Endpoint Service Allowed Principal resource
and a VPC Endpoint Service resource with an `allowed_principals` attribute. Do not use the same principal ARN in both
a VPC Endpoint Service resource and a VPC Endpoint Service Allowed Principal resource. Doing so will cause a conflict
and will overwrite the association.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```terraform
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

resource "aws_vpc_endpoint_service_allowed_principal" "allow_me_to_foo" {
  vpc_endpoint_service_id = aws_vpc_endpoint_service.foo.id
  principal_arn           = data.aws_caller_identity.current.arn
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `vpc_endpoint_service_id` - (Required) The ID of the VPC endpoint service to allow permission.
* `principal_arn` - (Required) The ARN of the principal to allow permissions.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the association.
