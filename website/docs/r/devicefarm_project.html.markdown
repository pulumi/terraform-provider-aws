# Resource: aws_devicefarm_project

Provides a resource to manage AWS Device Farm Projects.

For more information about Device Farm Projects, see the AWS Documentation on
[Device Farm Projects][aws-get-project].

~> **NOTE:** AWS currently has limited regional support for Device Farm (e.g., `us-west-2`). See [AWS Device Farm endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/devicefarm.html) for information on supported regions.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_devicefarm_project" "awesome_devices" {
  name = "my-device-farm"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `name` - (Required) The name of the project
* `default_job_timeout_minutes` - (Optional) Sets the execution timeout value (in minutes) for a project. All test runs in this project use the specified execution timeout value unless overridden when scheduling a run.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider `default_tags` configuration block present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name of this project
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider `default_tags` configuration block.
