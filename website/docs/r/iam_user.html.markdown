# Resource: aws_iam_user

Provides an IAM user.

~> *NOTE:* If policies are attached to the user via the `aws_iam_policy_attachment` resource and you are modifying the user `name` or `path`, the `force_destroy` argument must be set to `true` and applied before attempting the operation otherwise you will encounter a `DeleteConflict` error. The `aws_iam_user_policy_attachment` resource (recommended) does not have this requirement.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_iam_user" "lb" {
  name = "loadbalancer"
  path = "/system/"

  tags = {
    tag-key = "tag-value"
  }
}

resource "aws_iam_access_key" "lb" {
  user = aws_iam_user.lb.name
}

resource "aws_iam_user_policy" "lb_ro" {
  name = "test"
  user = aws_iam_user.lb.name

  policy = <<EOF
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "ec2:Describe*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
EOF
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The user's name. The name must consist of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: `=,.@-_.`. User names are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create users named both "TESTUSER" and "testuser".
* `path` - (Optional, default "/") Path in which to create the user.
* `permissions_boundary` - (Optional) The ARN of the policy that is used to set the permissions boundary for the user.
* `force_destroy` - (Optional, default false) When destroying this user, destroy even if it
  has non-provider-managed IAM access keys, login profile or MFA devices. Without `force_destroy`
  a user with non-provider-managed access keys and login profile will fail to be destroyed.
* `tags` - Key-value mapping of tags for the IAM user. If configured with a provider `default_tags` configuration block present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - The ARN assigned by AWS for this user.
* `name` - The user's name.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider `default_tags` configuration block.
* `unique_id` - The [unique ID][1] assigned by AWS.
