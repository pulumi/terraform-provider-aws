# Resource: aws_waf_web_acl

Provides a WAF Web ACL Resource

## Example Usage

This example blocks requests coming from `192.0.7.0/24` and allows everything else.

```terraform
resource "aws_waf_ipset" "ipset" {
  name = "tfIPSet"

  ip_set_descriptors {
    type  = "IPV4"
    value = "192.0.7.0/24"
  }
}

resource "aws_waf_rule" "wafrule" {
  depends_on  = [aws_waf_ipset.ipset]
  name        = "tfWAFRule"
  metric_name = "tfWAFRule"

  predicates {
    data_id = aws_waf_ipset.ipset.id
    negated = false
    type    = "IPMatch"
  }
}

resource "aws_waf_web_acl" "waf_acl" {
  depends_on = [
    aws_waf_ipset.ipset,
    aws_waf_rule.wafrule,
  ]
  name        = "tfWebACL"
  metric_name = "tfWebACL"

  default_action {
    type = "ALLOW"
  }

  rules {
    action {
      type = "BLOCK"
    }

    priority = 1
    rule_id  = aws_waf_rule.wafrule.id
    type     = "REGULAR"
  }
}
```

### Logging

~> *NOTE:* The Kinesis Firehose Delivery Stream name must begin with `aws-waf-logs-` and be located in `us-east-1` region. See the [AWS WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging.html) for more information about enabling WAF logging.

```terraform
resource "aws_waf_web_acl" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...
  logging_configuration {
    log_destination = aws_kinesis_firehose_delivery_stream.example.arn

    redacted_fields {
      field_to_match {
        type = "URI"
      }

      field_to_match {
        data = "referer"
        type = "HEADER"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `default_action` - (Required) Configuration block with action that you want AWS WAF to take when a request doesn't match the criteria in any of the rules that are associated with the web ACL. Detailed below.
* `metric_name` - (Required) The name or description for the Amazon CloudWatch metric of this web ACL.
* `name` - (Required) The name or description of the web ACL.
* `rules` - (Optional) Configuration blocks containing rules to associate with the web ACL and the settings for each rule. Detailed below.
* `logging_configuration` - (Optional) Configuration block to enable WAF logging. Detailed below.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. .If configured with a provider `default_tags` configuration block present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

### `default_action` Configuration Block

* `type` - (Required) Specifies how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests that don't match the criteria in any of the `rules`.
  e.g., `ALLOW` or `BLOCK`

### `logging_configuration` Configuration Block

* `log_destination` - (Required) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of Kinesis Firehose Delivery Stream
* `redacted_fields` - (Optional) Configuration block containing parts of the request that you want redacted from the logs. Detailed below.

#### `redacted_fields` Configuration Block

* `field_to_match` - (Required) Set of configuration blocks for fields to redact. Detailed below.

##### `field_to_match` Configuration Block

-> Additional information about this configuration can be found in the [AWS WAF Regional API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_regional_FieldToMatch.html).

* `data` - (Optional) When the value of `type` is `HEADER`, enter the name of the header that you want the WAF to search, for example, `User-Agent` or `Referer`. If the value of `type` is any other value, omit `data`.
* `type` - (Required) The part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified stringE.g., `HEADER` or `METHOD`

### `rules` Configuration Block

See [docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_ActivatedRule.html) for all details and supported values.

* `action` - (Optional) The action that CloudFront or AWS WAF takes when a web request matches the conditions in the rule. Not used if `type` is `GROUP`.
    * `type` - (Required) valid values are: `BLOCK`, `ALLOW`, or `COUNT`
* `override_action` - (Optional) Override the action that a group requests CloudFront or AWS WAF takes when a web request matches the conditions in the rule. Only used if `type` is `GROUP`.
    * `type` - (Required) valid values are: `NONE` or `COUNT`
* `priority` - (Required) Specifies the order in which the rules in a WebACL are evaluated.
  Rules with a lower value are evaluated before rules with a higher value.
* `rule_id` - (Required) ID of the associated WAF (Global) rule (e.g., `aws_waf_rule`). WAF (Regional) rules cannot be used.
* `type` - (Optional) The rule type, either `REGULAR`, as defined by [Rule](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_Rule.html), `RATE_BASED`, as defined by [RateBasedRule](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_RateBasedRule.html), or `GROUP`, as defined by [RuleGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_RuleGroup.html). The default is REGULAR. If you add a RATE_BASED rule, you need to set `type` as `RATE_BASED`. If you add a GROUP rule, you need to set `type` as `GROUP`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the WAF WebACL.
* `arn` - The ARN of the WAF WebACL.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider `default_tags` configuration block.

## Import

WAF Web ACL can be imported using the `id`, e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_waf_web_acl.main 0c8e583e-18f3-4c13-9e2a-67c4805d2f94
```
