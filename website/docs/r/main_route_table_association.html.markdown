# Resource: aws_main_route_table_association

Provides a resource for managing the main routing table of a VPC.

~> **NOTE:** **Do not** use both `aws_default_route_table` to manage a default route table **and** `aws_main_route_table_association` with the same VPC due to possible route conflicts. See aws_default_route_table documentation for more details.
For more information, see the Amazon VPC User Guide on [Route Tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html). For information about managing normal route tables in the provider, see `aws_route_table`.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_main_route_table_association" "a" {
  vpc_id         = aws_vpc.foo.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.bar.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `vpc_id` - (Required) The ID of the VPC whose main route table should be set
* `route_table_id` - (Required) The ID of the Route Table to set as the new
  main route table for the target VPC

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Route Table Association
* `original_route_table_id` - Used internally, see **Notes** below

## Notes

On VPC creation, the AWS API always creates an initial Main Route Table. This
resource records the ID of that Route Table under `original_route_table_id`.
The "Delete" action for a `main_route_table_association` consists of resetting
this original table as the Main Route Table for the VPC. You'll see this
additional Route Table in the AWS console; it must remain intact in order for
the `main_route_table_association` delete to work properly.
