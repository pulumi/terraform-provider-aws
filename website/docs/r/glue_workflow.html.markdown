# Resource: aws_glue_workflow

Provides a Glue Workflow resource.
The workflow graph (DAG) can be build using the `aws_glue_trigger` resource.
See the example below for creating a graph with four nodes (two triggers and two jobs).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_glue_workflow" "example" {
  name = "example"
}

resource "aws_glue_trigger" "example-start" {
  name          = "trigger-start"
  type          = "ON_DEMAND"
  workflow_name = aws_glue_workflow.example.name

  actions {
    job_name = "example-job"
  }
}

resource "aws_glue_trigger" "example-inner" {
  name          = "trigger-inner"
  type          = "CONDITIONAL"
  workflow_name = aws_glue_workflow.example.name

  predicate {
    conditions {
      job_name = "example-job"
      state    = "SUCCEEDED"
    }
  }

  actions {
    job_name = "another-example-job"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` – (Required) The name you assign to this workflow.
* `default_run_properties` – (Optional) A map of default run properties for this workflow. These properties are passed to all jobs associated to the workflow.
* `description` – (Optional) Description of the workflow.
* `max_concurrent_runs` - (Optional) Prevents exceeding the maximum number of concurrent runs of any of the component jobs. If you leave this parameter blank, there is no limit to the number of concurrent workflow runs.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. .If configured with a provider `default_tags` configuration block present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of Glue Workflow
* `id` - Workflow name
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider `default_tags` configuration block.

## Import

Glue Workflows can be imported using `name`, e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_glue_workflow.MyWorkflow MyWorkflow
```
