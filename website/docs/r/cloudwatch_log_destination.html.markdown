# Resource: aws_cloudwatch_log_destination

Provides a CloudWatch Logs destination resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_destination" "test_destination" {
  name       = "test_destination"
  role_arn   = aws_iam_role.iam_for_cloudwatch.arn
  target_arn = aws_kinesis_stream.kinesis_for_cloudwatch.arn
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) A name for the log destination.
* `role_arn` - (Required) The ARN of an IAM role that grants Amazon CloudWatch Logs permissions to put data into the target.
* `target_arn` - (Required) The ARN of the target Amazon Kinesis stream resource for the destination.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider `default_tags` configuration block present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) specifying the log destination.
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider `default_tags` configuration block.

CloudWatch Logs destinations can be imported using the `name`, e.g.,

```
$ terraform import aws_cloudwatch_log_destination.test_destination test_destination
```
