# Resource: aws_scheduler_schedule_group

Provides an EventBridge Scheduler Schedule Group resource.

You can find out more about EventBridge Scheduler in the [User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/scheduler/latest/UserGuide/what-is-scheduler.html).

~> **Note:** EventBridge was formerly known as CloudWatch Events. The functionality is identical.

## Example Usage

  name = "my-schedule-group"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are optional:

* `name_prefix` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Creates a unique name beginning with the specified prefix. Conflicts with `name`.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value mapping of resource tags. If configured with a provider `default_tags` configuration block present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

* `arn` - ARN of the schedule group.
* `creation_date` - Time at which the schedule group was created.
* `last_modification_date` - Time at which the schedule group was last modified.
* `state` - State of the schedule group. Can be `ACTIVE` or `DELETING`.
* `tags_all` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider `default_tags` configuration block.
