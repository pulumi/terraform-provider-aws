```terraform
resource "aws_auditmanager_account_registration" "example" {
  deregister_on_destroy = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are optional:

* `delegated_admin_account` - (Optional) Identifier for the delegated administrator account.
* `deregister_on_destroy` - (Optional) Flag to deregister AuditManager in the account upon destruction. Defaults to `false` (ie. AuditManager will remain active in the account, even if this resource is removed).
* `kms_key` - (Optional) KMS key identifier.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:
