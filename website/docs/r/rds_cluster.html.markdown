  Manages an RDS Aurora Cluster
---

# Resource: aws_rds_cluster

Manages a [RDS Aurora Cluster][2]. To manage cluster instances that inherit configuration from the cluster (when not running the cluster in `serverless` engine mode), see the `aws_rds_cluster_instance` resource. To manage non-Aurora databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.), see the `aws_db_instance` resource.

For information on the difference between the available Aurora MySQL engines
see [Comparison between Aurora MySQL 1 and Aurora MySQL 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Updates.20180206.html)
in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

Changes to an RDS Cluster can occur when you manually change a
parameter, such as `port`, and are reflected in the next maintenance
window. Because of this, this provider may report a difference in its planning
phase because a modification has not yet taken place. You can use the
`apply_immediately` flag to instruct the service to apply the change immediately
(see documentation below).

~> **Note:** using `apply_immediately` can result in a
brief downtime as the server reboots. See the AWS Docs on [RDS Maintenance][4]
for more information.

## Example Usage

### S3 Import Options

Full details on the core parameters and impacts are in the API Docs: [RestoreDBClusterFromS3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_RestoreDBClusterFromS3.html). Requires that the S3 bucket be in the same region as the RDS cluster you're trying to create. Sample:

~> **NOTE:** RDS Aurora Serverless does not support loading data from S3, so its not possible to directly use `engine_mode` set to `serverless` with `s3_import`.

```terraform
resource "aws_rds_cluster" "db" {
  engine = "aurora"

  s3_import {
    source_engine         = "mysql"
    source_engine_version = "5.6"
    bucket_name           = "mybucket"
    bucket_prefix         = "backups"
    ingestion_role        = "arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/role-xtrabackup-rds-restore"
  }
}
```

* `bucket_name` - (Required) The bucket name where your backup is stored
* `bucket_prefix` - (Optional) Can be blank, but is the path to your backup
* `ingestion_role` - (Required) Role applied to load the data.
* `source_engine` - (Required) Source engine for the backup
* `source_engine_version` - (Required) Version of the source engine used to make the backup

This will not recreate the resource if the S3 object changes in some way. It's only used to initialize the database. This only works currently with the aurora engine. See AWS for currently supported engines and options. See [Aurora S3 Migration Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Migrating.ExtMySQL.html#AuroraMySQL.Migrating.ExtMySQL.S3).

### restore_to_point_in_time Argument Reference

~> **NOTE:**  The DB cluster is created from the source DB cluster with the same configuration as the original DB cluster, except that the new DB cluster is created with the default DB security group. Thus, the following arguments should only be specified with the source DB cluster's respective values: `database_name`, `master_username`, `storage_encrypted`, `replication_source_identifier`, and `source_region`.

Example:

```terraform
resource "aws_rds_cluster" "example-clone" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  restore_to_point_in_time {
    source_cluster_identifier  = "example"
    restore_type               = "copy-on-write"
    use_latest_restorable_time = true
  }
}
```

* `source_cluster_identifier` - (Required) The identifier of the source database cluster from which to restore.
* `restore_type` - (Optional) Type of restore to be performed.
   Valid options are `full-copy` (default) and `copy-on-write`.

    timeout_action           = "ForceApplyCapacityChange"
  }
}
```

* `auto_pause` - (Optional) Whether to enable automatic pause. A DB cluster can be paused only when it's idle (it has no connections).
