# Resource: aws_devicefarm_instance_profile

Provides a resource to manage AWS Device Farm Instance Profiles.
âˆ‚
~> **NOTE:** AWS currently has limited regional support for Device Farm (e.g., `us-west-2`). See [AWS Device Farm endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/devicefarm.html) for information on supported regions.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_devicefarm_instance_profile" "example" {
  name = "example"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `name` - (Required) The name for the instance profile.
* `package_cleanup` - (Optional) When set to `true`, Device Farm removes app packages after a test run. The default value is `false` for private devices.
