# Resource: aws_route53domains_registered_domain

Provides a resource to manage a domain that has been [registered](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/registrar-tld-list.html) and associated with the current AWS account.

**This is an advanced resource** and has special caveats to be aware of when using it. Please read this document in its entirety before using this resource.

The `aws_route53domains_registered_domain` resource behaves differently from normal resources in that if a domain has been registered, the provider does not _register_ this domain, but instead "adopts" it into management. A destroy does not delete the domain but does remove the resource from state.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_route53domains_registered_domain" "example" {
  domain_name = "example.com"

  name_server {
    name = "ns-195.awsdns-24.com"
  }

  name_server {
    name = "ns-874.awsdns-45.net"
  }

  tags = {
    Environment = "test"
  }
}
```
