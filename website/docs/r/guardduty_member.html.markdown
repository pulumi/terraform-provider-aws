## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_guardduty_detector" "primary" {
  enable = true
}

resource "aws_guardduty_detector" "member" {
  provider = aws.dev

  enable = true
}

resource "aws_guardduty_member" "member" {
  account_id         = aws_guardduty_detector.member.account_id
  detector_id        = aws_guardduty_detector.primary.id
  email              = "required@example.com"
  invite             = true
  invitation_message = "please accept guardduty invitation"
}
```
