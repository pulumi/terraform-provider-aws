  local_domain_info {
    owner_id    = data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id
    region      = data.aws_region.current.name
    domain_name = aws_opensearch_domain.local_domain.domain_name
  }

  remote_domain_info {
    owner_id    = data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id
    region      = data.aws_region.current.name
    domain_name = aws_opensearch_domain.remote_domain.domain_name
  }
}

resource "aws_opensearch_inbound_connection_accepter" "foo" {
