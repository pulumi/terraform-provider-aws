# Resource: aws_db_instance

Provides an RDS instance resource.  A DB instance is an isolated database
environment in the cloud.  A DB instance can contain multiple user-created
databases.

Changes to a DB instance can occur when you manually change a parameter, such as
`allocated_storage`, and are reflected in the next maintenance window. Because
of this, this provider may report a difference in its planning phase because a
modification has not yet taken place. You can use the `apply_immediately` flag
to instruct the service to apply the change immediately (see documentation
below).

When upgrading the major version of an engine, `allow_major_version_upgrade` must be set to `true`.

~> **Note:** using `apply_immediately` can result in a brief downtime as the server reboots.
See the AWS Docs on [RDS Instance Maintenance][instance-maintenance] for more information.

~> **Note:** All arguments including the username and password will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.

## RDS Instance Class Types

Amazon RDS supports three types of instance classes: Standard, Memory Optimized, and Burstable Performance.
For more information please read the AWS RDS documentation about [DB Instance Class Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html)

## Low-Downtime Updates

By default, RDS applies updates to DB Instances in-place, which can lead to service interruptions.
Low-downtime updates minimize service interruptions by performing the updates with an [RDS Blue/Green deployment][blue-green] and switching over the instances when complete.

Low-downtime updates are only available for DB Instances using MySQL and MariaDB,
as other engines are not supported by RDS Blue/Green deployments.

Backups must be enabled to use low-downtime updates.

Enable low-downtime updates by setting `blue_green_update.enabled` to `true`.

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_db_instance" "default" {
  allocated_storage    = 10
  db_name              = "mydb"
  engine               = "mysql"
  engine_version       = "5.7"
  instance_class       = "db.t3.micro"
  username             = "foo"
  password             = "foobarbaz"
  parameter_group_name = "default.mysql5.7"
  skip_final_snapshot  = true
}
```

### Storage Autoscaling

To enable Storage Autoscaling with instances that support the feature, define the `max_allocated_storage` argument higher than the `allocated_storage` argument. This provider will automatically hide differences with the `allocated_storage` argument value if autoscaling occurs.

```terraform
resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
  # ... other configuration ...

  allocated_storage     = 50
  max_allocated_storage = 100
}
```

## Argument Reference

For more detailed documentation about each argument, refer to the [AWS official
documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDBInstance.html).

The following arguments are supported:

* `allocated_storage` - (Required unless a `snapshot_identifier` or `replicate_source_db` is provided) The allocated storage in gibibytes. If `max_allocated_storage` is configured, this argument represents the initial storage allocation and differences from the configuration will be ignored automatically when Storage Autoscaling occurs. If `replicate_source_db` is set, the value is ignored during the creation of the instance.
* `allow_major_version_upgrade` - (Optional) Indicates that major version
upgrades are allowed. Changing this parameter does not result in an outage and
the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.
* `apply_immediately` - (Optional) Specifies whether any database modifications
are applied immediately, or during the next maintenance window. Default is
`false`. See [Amazon RDS Documentation for more
information.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.html)
* `auto_minor_version_upgrade` - (Optional) Indicates that minor engine upgrades
will be applied automatically to the DB instance during the maintenance window.

* `replicate_source_db` - (Optional) Specifies that this resource is a Replicate
database, and to use this value as the source database. This correlates to the
`identifier` of another Amazon RDS Database to replicate (if replicating within

~> **NOTE:** Removing the `replicate_source_db` attribute from an existing RDS
Replicate database managed by the provider will promote the database to a fully
standalone database.

### Restore To Point In Time
